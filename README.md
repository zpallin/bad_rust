Bad Rust
========

This repository contains examples of bad rust as a lesson to others who want to use the language.

It started when I asked a [question to the Reddit Rust community](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/5boosa/can_anyone_provide_some_examples_of_bad_memory/) and found some good examples. I decided I wanted to make a repository based on this. I want to make sure I give credit to the people who wrote the code so I included their usernames in the source code and in the name of the examples.
